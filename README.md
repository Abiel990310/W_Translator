# The Ultimate Word Shredder 🌪️

**"Communication is overrated."** - *Someone who installed this extension.*

## What is this?

Are you tired of understanding what you read on the internet? Do you find clear, concise English to be boring and efficient?

**The Ultimate Word Shredder** is here to fix that!

This revolutionary Chrome extension takes perfectly good sentences and nukes them into oblivion by translating every single morpheme, prefix, and suffix literally. The result is a chaotic soup of meaning that sounds vaguely profound but makes absolutely no sense.

## Features

### 🚀 The Morpheme Mangler
We don't just translate words; we surgically remove their dignity.
*   **"Understand"** becomes **"Below Stand"** (Under + Stand)
*   **"Butterfly"** becomes **"Butter Fly"** (It's dairy that flies!)
*   **"Biology"** becomes **"Life Study"** (Actually, that one is accurate. We'll fix that in v2.0.)

### ☢️ The Nuclear Fallback
If we can't find a word in our massive database of doom, we resort to the **Nuclear Option**: Phonetic Transliteration.
*   "Cute" -> "Q"
*   "Cool" -> "酷" (Ku)
*   Every letter is replaced with a sound that vaguely resembles English spoken by a confused alien.

### 🛡️ Productivity Shield
You cannot be distracted by social media if you cannot read social media. This extension is the ultimate focus tool (because you will close your browser in frustration).

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository (if you can read this).
2.  Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
3.  Enable **Developer Mode** in the top right.
4.  Click **Load Unpacked**.
5.  Select the folder where you dumped this code.
6.  Go to any website and watch civilization crumble.

## Warning ⚠️

*   **Do not use this during exams.**
*   **Do not use this for legal documents.** (Unless you want to go to jail, or "Prison" -> "Pre Son" -> "Before Son"?)
*   **We are not responsible** if you forget your own language.

## Bugs

If you find a bug, congratulations! It's probably a feature. But tell us anyway.
